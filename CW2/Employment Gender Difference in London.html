        <h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>Gender differences in employment are a worldwide phenomenon, and London is no exception.
           It seems that in many cases, women face more difficult employment issues than men.
           In order to more intuitively show the employment inequality facing by men and women through the data,
           this project intends to figure out the exact differences in employment rate between males and females in London
           through different data visualization methods. Inspired by the report of
           Differences in Employment by Gender in London from London Datastore (2020),
           this project will also focus on the differences in employment by gender
           in particular the four aspects shown below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Gender differences in employment under different kinds of jobs.

          </li>
          <li> Gender differences in employment of different age groups.

          </li>
          <li> Gender differences in employment under the effect of having children.

          </li>
          <li> Gender differences in employment of different culture backgrounds.

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This project mainly analyse these four problems related to the main topic, the employment gender difference in London.
        Under each problem, we adapt different visualization methods to analyse the data based on their own characteristics.
        You could find individual web-page belong to each of the four problems. Click the link follows the problem to see more in details. </p>

        <h3>Summarize</h3>
        <p>Based on the data provided by Census Information Scheme (https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset), we obtain the following results:
        <ul>
            <li>For the gender differences in employment under different kinds of jobs, we conclude that females are more likely
                to have jobs in health and social activities and education areas, while males are mostly like to work in construction,
                transport and storage, and agriculture, energy and water areas. Some of the job fields do not show much difference between
                different gender, such as public administration and support activities, real estate activities and professional, scientific and technical activities.
                The results are reasonable and are consistent with our common sense.
            </li>
            <li>For the gender differences in employment of different age groups, we conclude that percentage point gap in employment rate
                between men and women has an in creasing tendency as the age grows, which means women at older age are more likely to suffer
                unemployment than men at the same age. Also, the gap rate reached a sub-peak at the age around 30, which indicate that women
                at that age have higher unemployment rate than men, which may caused by giving birth to their first child, and that speculation
                worth further analysis in the future. We can also find out that the employment rate gap between genders are getting smaller and
                smaller as time goes,the data in 2011 is lower compared with the data decades ago, which is good to see.</li>
            <li>For gender differences in employment under the effect of having children, we conclude that
                women with dependent children were less likely to work than those without dependent children,
                however, men do not shows much difference, and in some boroughs, men with dependent children were more
                likely to work, which is an interesting finding. Also, for both men and women, the difference in
                economic activity rate between with and without dependent children seems to be larger for them who live
                in center boroughs of London.
            </li>
            <li>For gender differences in employment of different culture backgrounds, in this project we focused on
                the data of percentage point difference in economic activity rate between men and women by ethnicity.
                From different country of birth, Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Arab are the top three which have the
                largest gap between males and females, while Chinese, White and Black Caribbean and
                Caribbean has the smallest economic activity rate gap.

            </li>
        </ul></p>

        <h3>Interesting Findings</h3>
        <p>Through this project, there are two interesting findings:</p>
        <p>The first one is that, through our data, the employment rate or economic activity rate of men are always
            higher than women no matter through the lens of job areas, age groups or culture backgrounds. As a result,
            when computing the employment rate gap by using men's value minus women's value, the result is always positive.
            And that may, to some extent, shows that women are still likely to be negatively affected by gender in employment.
        </p>
        <p>The second one is that, when exploring the gender differences in employment under the effect of having children,
            the result of the male's side is quite interesting. In common sense, it is reasonable for a person to quit his or her job
            after he or she has a children. However, the result shows that men with dependent children were more likely to work.
        </p>

        <h3>Strength and Limitation of the Approach</h3>
        <p>This part are detailed introduced under each problem's own web-page based on different approaches.</p>

        <h3>Conclusions</h3>
        <p>In this project, we exploring the employment gender difference in London through the four aspects mentioned before.</p>
        <p> - When analyse the data about the gender differences in employment under different kinds of jobs or culture backgrounds,
            we implement stacked bar chart to illustrate the difference and percentage of both genders clearly. For the stacked  bar chart,
            it reflects the proportion of men and women better. In the future, it will be good to think about ways to show the difference more
            intuitively, for example, implementing a bar chart which shows the difference gap and connect the bar chart with the stacked bar chart
            by jobs or culture backgrounds.</p>
        <p> - When analyse the data about the gender differences in employment of different age groups, we use multiple line chart
            to show how the employment gap between gender varies with the increasing of age. Also the multiple lines representing
            data of different decades and the multiple line chart may also illustrate the tendency of the gap changes through decades.
            From the plot, the gap rate reached a sub-peak at the age around 30, which indicate that women at that age have higher
            unemployment rate than men, which may caused by giving birth to their first child, and that speculation
            worth further analysis in the future. It would be useful to combine this data with another data which record the age of women when
            they give birth to their first child.</p>
        <p>To illustrate the difference in economic activity rate between with and without dependent children by borough for both males and females,
            we use the choropleth map of the Greater London, coloring each borough by its gap rate between with and without dependent children. In that way
            we could intuitively get from the picture that for women, it is really common to quit their jobs or stay at an unemployment state after they have
            a child, while for men, the gap rate is closely to zero. From now, we could only compare result between males and females by two separate choropleth
            maps using the same color scale. However, in the future, I will try to find some methods to show the difference between gender by borough more intuitively.</p>
