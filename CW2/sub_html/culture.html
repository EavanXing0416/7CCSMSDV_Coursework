    <h1>Gender Differences in Employment of Different Culture Backgrounds</h1>
    <p>The conclusion and plots are as follows: </p>
    <p>For gender differences in employment of different culture backgrounds, in this project we focused on
        the data of percentage point difference in economic activity rate between men and women by ethnicity.
        From different country of birth, Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Arab are the top three which have the
        largest gap between males and females, while Chinese, White and Black Caribbean and
        Caribbean has the smallest economic activity rate gap.</p>

    <p>As we observe from the stacked bar chart, we find that the proportion for most bars are closely to half and half.
        That makes it hard for us to know the exactly difference between men and women. As a result, we then generate the bar chart
        to show the difference directly.</p>
