    <h1>Gender Differences in Employment under Different Jobs</h1>
    <p>The conclusion and plots are as follows: </p>
    <p>For the gender differences in employment under different kinds of jobs, we conclude that females are more likely
        to have jobs in health and social activities and education areas, while males are mostly like to work in
        construction, transport and storage, and agriculture, energy and water areas. Some of the job fields do not
        show much difference between different gender, such as public administration and support activities, real estate
        activities and professional, scientific and technical activities. The results are reasonable and are consistent
        with our common sense.</p>
    <p>By using the method of the stacked bar chart, we could clearly get the difference and percentage of both genders
        under different industries and job areas. However, the stacked bar chart cannot shows the exact value of the difference,
        which is the area that the blue ones is larger pr smaller than the red ones under each bar.</p>
