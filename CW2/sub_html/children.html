    <h1>Gender Differences in Employment under the Effect of Having Children</h1>
    <p>The conclusion and plots are as follows: </p>
    <p>For gender differences in employment under the effect of having children, we conclude that
        women with dependent children were less likely to work than those without dependent children,
        however, men do not shows much difference, and in some boroughs, men with dependent children were more
        likely to work, which is an interesting finding. Also, for both men and women, the difference in
        economic activity rate between with and without dependent children seems to be larger for them who live
        in center boroughs of London.</p>
    <p>By using the choropleth map of London, coloring each borough by its gap rate between with and without dependent children. We calculate the
        gap rate between with and without dependent children by using economic activity rate with children minus without children. The positive value
        means that people with children are more likely to work or to be employed, while the negative means tha opposite. We also create the color scale
        to show the data in a more intuitively way. We use red to show the most negative values and blue the most positive values.In that way
        we could intuitively get from the picture that for women, it is really common to quit their jobs or stay at an unemployment state after they have
        a child, because the map for women are almost in red color and the color closer to the center is redder. While for men, the gap rate is closely to zero,
        because the map for men are almost in purple color which indicates the gap rate is around zero. For now, we could only compare result between males and females by two separate choropleth
        maps using the same color scale, although it could shows the gap rate clearly and intuitively and make reasonable comparisons between males and females, there is still inconvenience for us to get the
        information of one borough of both genders, because we have to look up into two maps to compare. As a result, in the future, I will try to find some methods to show the difference between gender by borough more intuitively.</p>
