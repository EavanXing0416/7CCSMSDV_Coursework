    <h1>Gender Differences in Employment of Different Age Groups</h1>
    <p>The conclusion and plots are as follows: </p>
    <p>For the gender differences in employment of different age groups, we conclude that percentage point gap in employment rate
        between men and women has an in creasing tendency as the age grows, which means women at older age are more likely to suffer
        unemployment than men at the same age. Also, the gap rate reached a sub-peak at the age around 30, which indicate that women
        at that age have higher unemployment rate than men, which may caused by giving birth to their first child, and that speculation
        worth further analysis in the future. We can also find out that the employment rate gap between genders are getting smaller and
        smaller as time goes,the data in 2011 is lower compared with the data decades ago, which is good to see.</p>
    <p>By using the multi-linea chart to illustrate that problem, we could clearly get the tendency of how the percentage point gap in employment rate
        between men and women varies as the age grows. We calculating the gap rate by using the men's employment rate minus the women's, and if the value
        is positive, it means that under the same situation, the employment rate of men is higher than that of women. As we can see from the chart, the rates
        are always positive and increase with the age. However, compare with the three lines, we could find out the lines are getting lower as time goes,
        which is a good phenomenon which shows that with the development of the times, the difference in the employment rate between men and women is decreasing. </p>
